# myNotes
This was created from Brad Traversy Tutorials in a Udemy Course.
I built a pure javascrip app (no frameworks) using a "fake" json server to mimic a rest API and it stores the data in local storage. There's also an http library.
I also use webpack&babel to support ES2015 browsers. It was an old tutorial, now is supported in all major browsers.
